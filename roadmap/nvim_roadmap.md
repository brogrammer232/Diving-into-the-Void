# NeoVim Roadmap

## Foundations

+ Learn modal editing and basic motions:
    - Start with `:Tutor` to get comfortable with Normal, Insert, and Visual modes.
    - Focus on core motions: `hjkl`, `w/b/e`, `0/$`, `gg/G`, and text objects like `vi(`.

+ Get familiar with Lua:
    - Learn basic syntax, modules and safe table usage.
    - You don't need deep mastery.
