# Shell Scripting

> **Random Quote:** Above all else, guard your heart, for everything you do flows from it.

This roadmap provides a structured and in-depth guide to mastering **shell scripting**. Shell scripting is a foundational skill for system administrators, OS developers, and power users. It enables automation, customization, and direct control over system behavior.

While many tutorials cover only the basics, this roadmap is designed to go far beyond elementary syntax. Whether the goal is to write resilient servie scripts under `runit`, build automation tools, or understand how a Linux system fits together at runtime, the material covered here forms an essential knowledge base.

This guide assumes familiarity with the command line and basic Unix/Linux usage, but does not require prior scripting experience. Each section builds on the previous one, progressing from fundamental concepts to advanced techniques and real-world use cases.
