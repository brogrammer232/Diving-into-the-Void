# Void Linux Mastery Roadmap

> **Random Quote:** As iron sharpens iron, so one man sharpens another.

> **Note:** This roadmap is not done. It's a work in progress.

This roadmap is tailored for deep Void Linux system mastery with a long-term goal of building an Operating System. It doesn't just teach you how to *use* Void Linux, it shows you how to *understand* and eventually *replace* parts of it.
