# Diving into the Void

> **Random Quote:** The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and the knowledge of the Holy One is insight.

Welcome to **Diving into the Void**, a detailed look into the Void Linux distribution. This repository is a serious deep dive into how Void Linux works (its tools, structure, and design choices). The goal is to understand how a modern, minimal Linux system is built and managed. This knowledge will help me as I work on creating my own operating system. If you're new to Void or want to learn more about it, these notes are meant to be clear, useful, and easy to follow.
