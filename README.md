# Diving into the Void

This repository will contain notes on Void Linux. The notes will dive deep into Void Linux, how it works and even patching and replacing stuff. We may go as far as compiling a patched Linux kernel. The sky is the limit.


I haven't thought about this. It's new, it's messy. I'm working on it. In the meantime, you can check my other repository, [Crafting an OS:Notes and Insights](https://github.com/brogrammer232/Crafting-an-OS-Notes-and-Insights.git). It contains really nice notes on OS development.
